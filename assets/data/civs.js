      "The Greeks are the generalist civilization of Age of Empires Online. Their gameplay is very straightforward and rock-paper-scissor oriented, giving them a clear answer to anything thrown at them. They are a great first choice for any beginner. Use the Greeks' mighty Hoplites to tank in the frontlines while your Gastraphetes, Ballistas and other Ranged units rain death on your opponent. Use Hippikons to flank enemy backlines and take out their key units in battle.",

      "The most notable difference between Egyptians and other civilizations is their age-up and empowerment mechanics. They are able to age up by building Temples instead of researching a technology in their Town Center. Each of those temples provide them with unique and powerful priests that can be used for economic, military and utility purposes. They have access to powerful War Elephants and Elephant Archers in their Fortress and their barracks units are cheap and very quick to produce. Just when you thought you've won against the Egyptians, another stampede of powerful Elephants, Slingers, Axemen and Spearmen come swarming your way.",

Even though their Unit roster may have more holes in it than any other civilization, their brute force and frightening mobility makes for a potentially risky but very rewarding experience.",

Able to be toggled on and off at any moment's notice, they allow the Persians to adjust their stategy on the fly and adapt to any situation. Command the powerful Persian Immortals, who posses both a Melee and a Ranged attack and can decimate any Infantry unit in their wake, or the mighty Asabaras, extremely versatile and well-rounded Cavalry units who join the fight as early as Age 2. In the lategame, you have access to War Wagons that can tear enemy Ranged Units to shreds with ease, all while the tanky Sparabara withstand large amounts of punishment at the front lines.",

Even though the Babylonians have access to a Military on par with other civilizations, you will find yourself securing an advantage and winning the game when utilizing their incredibly powerful Economic upgrades and their Gardens, which reduce the training and research time of all Buildings while also granting you a trickle of Food.",

The Norse also have access to War Dogs, fast, mobile Units that cost no population (but have a Build Limit) that can greatly slow down enemy Units, allowing your Army to catch up and send them to their demise. When playing the Norse, you will find that you will always be in control of the map. Use your map control wisely to secure yourself an advantage!",

Having Officers in your army can quickly make the difference between a decisive victory and a crushing defeat. The Romans are fairly well-rounded, like their Greek counterparts, but are also generally more expensive and even more bottle-necked by their Economy. Utilize Roman Engineers to greatly speed up Building construction while your Villagers spend more time gathering resources rather than constructing Buildings.",

They also have access to Gatherer Elephants - a specialist worker unit that gathers resources much faster than Villagers, but cannot repair any buildings and can only construct Plantations, which is a unique Indian Farm that can be utilized by more than one gatherer. In the lategame, you have access to Juggernauts which are extremely powerful but also extremely expensive armored Elephant units that can dominate any fight, but are very costly to replace if lost, and also vulnerable to enemy Priest units.",
